Single displacement amplitudes were measured, using the minimum filtering possible, by fitting lines through the baseline noise on either side of an event, and (where possible) through the noise at the plateau of the event.”</p>

<p><strong>Title: Detection of single-molecule interactions using correlated thermal diffusion</strong><br />
<em>Spudich Lab</em></p>
<p>tl;dr - Track the position of two beads. Since they are connected by a (taut) actin filament brownian motion of one bead is transmitted to the other so the bead position is correlated (i.e. one bead moves left and pulls other bead left). When a stiffer myosin binds the correlation goes away because the head interrupts the translation of bead movement.</p>
<p>This seems to be the precursor analysis to co-variance. Seems this analysis could counteract bad signal to noise because this method is not looking at signal variance or displacement from baseline, but position correlation between 2 beads.</p>
<p>How: Essentially is a rolling linear regression to a set of small windows and return the r (i.e. correlation coefficient value). This will generate 2 seperate (slightly overlapping gaussians) that distinguish bound from unbound periods (unbound r ~0.5, and unbound is close 0).

<p><strong>MV-Pros:</strong>
* No hand selection of events / manual scoring
* model independent transformation
* requires no assumptions/interpretation of the actual data</p>
<p><strong>MV-Cons:</strong>
* Time-ons / event duration estimated indirectly through post-analysis fits.
* Step sizes are time-weighted. Long duration events/displacements will be emphasized as they will contribute many counts to the histograms.</p>
<p><strong>Additional:</strong>
* Histograms emphasize periods where data is constant throughout window (transitions cause spikes/archs between the two populations)
* the mean dimension is a sum of multiple gaussians
* variance is chi-squared</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong>
* Calculate running mean and variance of trap data
* assemble into 3d-histogram(x = mean, y = variance, z = counts/cumulative time/‘volume’ i.e.number of data points within a given mean variance bin)
* fitting a peak can be approximated by the product of the PDF in the mean and variance dimension
* time-ons:
* volume of each component is related to 1) window width (N), 2) event duration (ton), and 3) the number of events (k)
* relationship between volumes (y) vs window width (x)</p>

<p>Title: The Stiffness of Rabbit Skeletal Actomyosin Cross-Bridges Determined with an Optical Tweezers Transducer</p>
<p>This paper has great details on the laser trap setup and how their experiments are designed. The great bulk of the paper is dealing with calculating the stiffness of actin, the bead-actin connection, and cross bridge stiffness.</p>
<p>They implement 2 QPDs in this paper to measure position of 2 beads simultaneously. They use this to answer questions that seemed to arise from the 1995 and other previous papers about their estimates about myosin displacements. They state:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does the motion of a single bead correctly measure the motion of the entire bead-actin-bead assembly, i.e., does the system behave as a nearly “rigid dumbbell”?</li>
<li>Does the actin filament change length significantly during cross-bridge attachments?</li>
<li>Do artifactual displacements arise if the actin filament binds to HMM that is situated with an orthogonal displace-ment to the filament center line?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Analysis</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Attachments were detected from the increase in stiffness(Molloy et al., 1995), and the amplitude of each was measured relative to the mean rest positions for the two beads(Fig. 6D). Attachments were detected automatically by calculating the running variance of the position data (fivepoints), applying a median filter (31 points) to the calculated variance, and then thresholding this data. The data associ-ated with attached intervals were removed, and the remaining data were corrected for baseline drift. Attachment event amplitudes were obtained from the median point in the datarelative to corrected baseline at the middle time point of theevent. The distributions of event amplitudes, measured sep-arately from data obtained for left and right 4QDs, areshowninFig.6D,a,b. These histograms were fitted wellby a single Gaussian distribution, indicating that the dataconsists of a single population of events. Therefore themean amplitude of the events was used to measure theaverage movement produced by the cross-bridge. The spread of the data is explained by the randomizing effect of Brownian motion (Molloy et al., 1995). Both distributions were centered at 5 nm from mean rest position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>They never explain what “thresholding this data” means or how they determine this value.</strong></p>
<p>The (summarized) answers from the 3 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Yes - systems behaves as rigid dumbbell because the position of the 2 beads is well correlated during myosin attachment.</li>
<li>No - actin length does not change during attachment. Histograms of event displacements from left and right bead = 0.</li>
<li>No - myosin always pulls one way and even if not aligned it will still pull toward negative side actin. Again, the histograms of right and left trap and their difference is 0 indicating only displacements in the x direction.</li>

<p>Title: Analysis of single-molecule mechanical recordings: application to acto-myosin interactions
_Veigel &amp; Molloy are co-authors__</p>
<p>Good review of trapping techniques and analysis methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using Brownian motion to detect events is limited in time resolution because of the roll-off frequency of the thermal noise (Eq. (2)), typically around 100 Hz. Resolution is limited not by the bandwidth of the detector system or methods of analysis but by the lack of signal in this frequency range. By oscillating one optical tweezer at low amplitude and high frequency (e.g. 1 kHz) and measuring theamplitude or phase of the 1 kHz signal at the other bead we can increase the time resolution to ~1ms. This is very useful for motors with relatively fast kinetics, such as muscle myosins. In order to measure myosin and connection stiffnesses much larger forces must be applied sothat the acto-myosin complex is measurably distorted. To do this a low frequency, highamplitude, forcing function (e.g. 100 Hz, 300 nm) is used and the position of both beads recorded(see Veigel et al., 1998).”</p>

<p><strong>Title: Two independent mechanical events in the interaction cycle of skeletal muscle myosin with actin</strong></p>
<p><em>First time hitch is seen in skeletal myosin</em></p>
<p>Analysis:
* Variance HM-Model (cites Smith 2001) to ID events</p>
<ul>
<li>threshold algorithm to pinpoint exact start of event for ensemble-average
<ul>
<li>50 microsecond running variance (advance 1 point)</li>
<li>discard events that were ID’d by HM-Model, but did not meet variance threshold</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extend ensemble average by taking the single last or first point and extending out</li>
<li>They simulated data and calculated on average how far off true start they were with their threshold
<ul>
<li>the value was systematic so they corrected the start of the events by moving the ID start point back in time by their calculated value</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Estimate attachment (f) and detachment rates (g) as inverse of the average of time-on/time-offs (i.e. 1/avg(time on))</p>
<p>You can estimate myosin stiffness by taking equipartion of the binding events.</p>

<p><strong>Important: MATLAB license is $2150 perpetual or $860/year</strong></p>
<p>Program works by ID events witg covariance or variance threshold and then chanepoint on the whole event (seems to do changepoint on mean and variance)
User defined features:
1. Minimum time on (Veigel &amp; Molloy do this) to prevent random noise being counted as an event
2. Time between events (program will ignore events that are too close together in time based on users input)
3. Manually adjust the change point window search
4. Manually adjust the change points themselves
* Why even use a fancy algorithm if you are going to just pick your locations by hand? and introduce user-bias
* they are probably doing this because sometimes the variance can fluctuate in an event and be mistakely ID as the start/end of an event
* I have had problems with this and is why I only look at small windows around HM-Model start/end of events telling changepoint there is one change</p>
<p>Questions:
’What changepoint methods? what penalty? what algorithm to calculate penalty? are they using the raw data?</p>
<p>Throwing away a lot of data!
&gt; When the single threshold method was used to detect binding interactions, we applied a filter to ignore any detected interactions which were shorter than 77 ms or within 63 ms of another detected interaction, to avoid including false positive interactions</p>
